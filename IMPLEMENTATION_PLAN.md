  - Location: Otthon, Iskola, Kint, Egy√©b

STRESS/EVENTS:
  - Free text field
  - Common tags: "Iskola", "L√°togat√°s", "Utaz√°s"
```

**Data Model Update:**
```javascript
entry: {
  id, date, timestamp, symptomId, intensity, duration, note,
  // NEW FIELDS:
  context: {
    mood?: string,      // emoji key
    energy?: string,    // emoji key
    activity?: string,  // emoji key
  },
  triggers?: {
    foods?: [{ name, timeBefore }],

## Design Principles

1. **Child Mode = Zero Friction**
   - Optional context, never required
   - Big buttons, no typing
   - Max 3 taps to log symptom

2. **Parent Mode = Medical-Grade**
   - Detailed tracking available
   - All features accessible
   - Export-ready data

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core features work first
   - Advanced features don't break simple flow
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Privacy First**
   - All data local (localStorage)
   - No cloud unless requested
   - Export = user controls data

---

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Consider Context API or Zustand for complex state
- Separate stores for symptoms, entries, foods, meds

### Performance
- Virtualized lists for long entry history
- Lazy load analytics charts
- Optimize image uploads (compression)

### Accessibility
- Large touch targets (min 44x44px)
- High contrast colors
- Screen reader support
- Simple language for 7yo

### Data Migration
- Version localStorage keys
- Migration scripts for schema changes
- Backup/restore functionality

---

## Success Metrics

- **Child engagement**: Can log in <10 seconds
- **Parent insights**: Clear trigger patterns visible
- **Medical value**: Doctors find reports useful
- **Data quality**: 80%+ entries have context
- **Usability**: 7yo can use independently

---

## Future Ideas (Post-MVP)

- Multi-language support
- Share reports via email
- Integration with health apps
- Symptom prediction ML
- Caregiver collaboration (multiple parents)
- School nurse access (read-only)
